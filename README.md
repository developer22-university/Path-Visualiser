# Path-Visualiser
2d-GRID BASED PATH VISUALISER    [A* ALGORITHM EXPLANATION](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html)


It is a 2-D maze generation and optimal path-finder that has been developed using PyGame (a Python set of modules).

It uses the heuristic A-Star algorithm to determine paths between 2 nodes in a Two-Dimenstional Grid with some obstacles in between (which is dependent on the interactive user where he/she wants to place them). Based on a heuristic function, different possible paths are traversed and once the final node is reached; using backtracking the shortest path is found and visualised. The project aims at understanding how the A-Star algorithm actually functions and can be visually interpreted.
 
 ## Requirements
Installing Pygame.

Try any one of the following two commands:
pip install pygame
After installing Pygame, simply run the command to run the Project:
python text.py
